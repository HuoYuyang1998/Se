*Data Description:

data.csv: The original house price dataset from Kaggle, which contains 4, 251 observations after removing the missing data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata). The data records the house price and other covariates about house area, location, building years and so on.


*Code Description:
House price analysis.R: The R code for reproducing Table S6. The replications are implemented by parallelization.

Function_scop_house.R: The R code for functions used in the simulations, which is a little different from the functions files in other simulations, since selection rule is to select individuals with larger values.

AlgorithmClass_scop.R: The R code for algorithm (model) classes used in the simulations.
